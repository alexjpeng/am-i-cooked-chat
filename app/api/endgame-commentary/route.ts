Generate a short, snarky commentary (max 100 characters) about the player's performance. 
If the player won, it could be congratulatory but still teasing. If the AI won, it should be more mocking.
Use all lowercase, include emojis, and make it sound like casual internet speech.

Examples:
- "you got cooked by gpt-4o-mini in 3 clicks. ngmi"
- "maybe you didn't get enough pretraining in the womb. cooked."
- "absolutely cracked. you might be safe from agi (for now)"
- "took you long enough üíÄ but at least you beat a language model at navigation lol"`;
